# 2-Shell-Hamiltonian
This code was written for an internship at Duke University under the sponsorship of the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratories. It calculates the Hamiltonian matrix for a 2-shell system. The main file is the Hamiltonian.java file. The file was EigenvalueDecomposition.java is used as a library to help with the calculations of the main code.
